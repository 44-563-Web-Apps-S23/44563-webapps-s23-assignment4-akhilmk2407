Git in there, <h6>Mister Revenue.</h6></p>

     <p>[<h6>REVENUE</h6>, _a Northerner in city attire, without hat, clothes dusty,
     is pushed through doorway_. LUKE, _a lanky, ill-dressed Southerner,
     following, closes door_. REVENUE'S _hands are tied behind him_.</p>

<p><h6>LUKE.</h6> You must excuse the boys for makin' a demonstration over you,
    <h6>Mister Revenue</h6>, but you see they don't come across you fellers very
frequent, and they allus gits excited.</p>

<p><h6>REVENUE</h6>. I appreciate that I'm welcome.</p>

<p><h6>LUKE.</h6> 'Deed you is, and I'm just agoin' to untie your hands long nuff
fer you to take a sociable drink. <p>[_Goes to stranger, feels in
all-pockets for weapons._]</p> Reckon yer travellin' peaceable. <p>[_Unties
hands._]</p> Won't yer sit down?</p>

<p><h6>REVENUE</h6>. <p>[_Drawing over chair and sitting._]</p> Thank you. <p>[_Rubs wrists to
get back circulation._]</p></p>

<p><h6>LUKE.</h6> <p>[_Going over to cupboard and taking out jug._]</p> Yessa, <h6>Mister</h6>, the
boys ain't seen one o' you fellers fer near two years. Began to think
